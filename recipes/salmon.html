    <h2>Ingredients Required</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Salmon Fillet</li>
        <li>Whole Lemon</li>
        <li>Butter (stick)</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You’ll first need to line your baking tray with foil; fold up the edges a bit so the garlic butter sauce doesn’t spill out.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon on the foil-lined tray, then nestle lemon slices underneath. </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together the melted butter, lemon juice, garlic, and honey. Pour most of it over the salmon, but reserve a little bit for serving.</li>
        <li>Season the salmon with salt and pepper, then fold the foil over the filets and bake. </li>
        <li>You’ll need to bake the salmon for about 17 minutes in a sealed foil pack and then unseal it so the salmon is exposed.</li>
        <li>At this point, switch over to broiler mode and let the broiler crisp up the top and edges of the salmon.</li>
